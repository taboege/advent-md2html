# This is a test

Some `Perl 6` code:

``` perl6
# This isn't meant to make sense but use a lot of syntax.
sub fx ($bytes, $chunking? where *.so) {
    react whenever $bytes -> *@chunk {
        gather print .format("%02x")
          for @chunkÂ».map(*.Int but False)
          andthen .take;
        say ++$, ...
        # FIXME: does this highlight?
    }
}
```
